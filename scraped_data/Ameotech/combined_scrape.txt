Cases
Fashion House & e-Commerce From Click to Conversion
Challenge:
Despite substantial traffic driving visitors to the website, the client faced a significant issue with low conversion rates. While the site attracted a steady stream of visitors, these interactions weren't translating into sales, leaving overall revenue far below expectations.
Solutions:
We optimized the websiteâs user experience, simplified navigation, and improved mobile functionality. Through A/B testing, better calls-to-action, and targeted ads, we re-engaged visitors. Product pages were enhanced with compelling descriptions, images, and reviews to boost conversions.
Results:
As a result, conversion rates increased by 35% in two months, driving a 50% boost in revenue. Improved user experience and targeted marketing turned traffic into loyal, repeat customers.

The app also offered multiple payment options, including credit/debit card payments and mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Wallet.
To ensure the security of users' information, Ameotech Informatics implemented a secure payment gateway and integrated the app with a reliable back-end server that could handle high volumes of traffic. The app also featured a rating and review system that allowed users to rate their food and delivery experience, helping the client to improve their services
Results
The food delivery app clone developed by Ameotech Informatics was a success, with the client reporting high user engagement and positive feedback from customers. The app helped the client to enter the food delivery market and compete with established players like Swiggy and Zomato.

Appointment
KATON DIRECT
Specializes in healthcare recruitment, focusing on connecting
                    healthcare providers with qualified nursing professionals. They sought
                    to streamline their recruitment processes, ensuring that healthcare
                    facilities could efficiently and quickly hire the necessary talent.
They sought to streamline their recruitment processes, ensuring that
            healthcare facilities could efficiently and quickly hire the necessary talent.
Challenges Faced by Katon Direct
Katon Direct faced several significant challenges that were hindering their ability to recruit nurses effectively
Inefficient Recruitment Processes: -
Existing methods were outdated,
        causing delays in hiring qualified nurses
Difficulty in Reaching Targeted Nurse Talent Pools : -
They struggled to
        effectively reach specific nurse demographics, leading to a limited pool of
        candidates.
Fragmented Communication and Manual Processes : -
The reliance on
        manual processes and fragmented communication channels resulted in
        operational inefficiencies, further slowing down recruitment
Solution Provided by Ameotech
Admin Interface for Hospital Management : -
Ameotech developed a robust web based admin interface, allowing Katon Direct to seamlessly register hospitals and their management staff. This interface serves as the central hub for all recruitment activities,
             enabling hospitals to manage their recruitment needs efficiently
Web Portal for Hospital Staff : -
A sophisticated web portal was created to empower hospital staff to search for nurses within a specified radius (from 10 km to any desired
              range) and initiate recruitment campaigns. Hospital staff can filter and search for nurses based on location, qualifications, and other relevant criteria, allowing them to target specific talent pools.
Mobile App for On-the-Go Accessibility : -
To
             complement the web portal, a mobile app with the
             same functionality was developed, ensuring
             that
             hospital
              staff can manage recruitment activities
             from anywhere
Web Portal and Mobile App for Nurses : -
A user-friendly
              platform was developed where nurses could log in to track
              their recruitment status, view updates, and communicate with potential employers.
Results
The implementation of Ameotech's solutions led to substantial improvements in Katon Direct's recruitment process:
-50%
Reduction in Time to-Hire.
The new system significantly decreased the time needed to hire nurses.
+65%
Increase in Talent Pool Reach.
The targeted outreach strategy expanded the pool of qualified candidates.
+80%
Improvement in Operational Efficiency.
Automation and streamlined communication led to smoother operations and faster decision-making.

Our Experience
Clients Satisfaction
Had some very specific requests for design of my UX/UI
                        and was interested in getting it into a staging
                        environment to have some static pages done up. Good
                        work.
...
While it wasn't always right on the first try,
                          that was partially due to me passing over Balsamiq
                          mockups. The end result was good quality work. Spend a
                          little more time on the discussions, planning things
                          out, sending over very specific instructions or design,
                          and Jatin, and this firm (Ameotech) are absolutely a
                          good company to work with.

Our Approach
We started optimizing one existing campaign [Painted Auto Body Parts] and created 3 new campaigns with different objectives. The three new campaigns were as follows:
Make/Model Campaign:
Itâs the type of search campaign with top-selling products.
Smart Shopping Campaign:
Itâs a shopping campaign with all the products.
Performance Max-1 Campaign:
Itâs a new goal-based campaign that allows performance advertisers to access all their Google Ads inventory from a single campaign.
Smart Shopping campaign [Top Models]:
As the name suggests, itâs a shopping campaign with top products.
Strategy
In Paid Marketing, itâs important to ensure good ROI. This generally means that the revenue must be more than of invested money. To make sure that we get desired ROI, We started with competitor analysis and keyword research including keywords bids to outrank the competitors.
        The first step was to list keywords that could add value to the campaign. For that, we have identified relevant keywords with high search volume and trends.
Campaign Was Optimized Considering Following Areas
What Time Suits the Best?
Website USPs in Ad Copies
Extensions for Appealing Ads
Targeted Locations
Daily Budget
Focus on Improving Quality Score and Ad Rank.
Bid Adjustments Based on Keywords, Devices, and Locations
End Result
After all the changes, I got 274.00 conversions. The total conversion value was higher than the total spend. I delivered 8.1X ROI in the second month.
